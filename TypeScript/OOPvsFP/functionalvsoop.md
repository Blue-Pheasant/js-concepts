# Functional Programming vs. Object-oriented Programming with TypeScript

This repo is inspired by a Youtube video from Firebase team!

### Installation TypeScript

```
yarn add -D typescript
```

Note: since babel-jest@24 has issues when compiling code from `.ts` to `.js`, we have to turn back its previous version

```
yarn add -D jest@23 babel-jest@23
```

### Compile the code

```
npx tsc --init
npx tsc
```
