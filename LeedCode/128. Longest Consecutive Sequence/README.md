# LeedCode 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

Note: This challenge is tagged as a `hard` problem on Leedcode.

<b>Problem:</b> Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

<i>Note:</i> Your algorithm should run in O(n) time, which n is the length of the array.

<b>Example:</b>

```
Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explaination: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Hence, the its length is 4.
```
